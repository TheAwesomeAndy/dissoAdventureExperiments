# Verification Methodology and Trustworthiness

This document explains how every script in the ARSPI-Net repository is independently verified, what the verification tests prove, and why readers should trust the experimental results.

---

## Why Verification Matters

Scientific code must be transparent. A reader encountering this repository should be able to answer three questions:

1. **Does the code run?** Syntax errors, missing imports, or incompatible APIs would prevent reproduction.
2. **Does the code compute what it claims?** A function named `permutation_entropy` should actually compute permutation entropy, not something else.
3. **Are the results trustworthy?** The pipeline should produce consistent, deterministic outputs that match the claimed methodology.

The 380 automated tests across 12 verification scripts answer all three questions without requiring the proprietary [Stress, Health, and the Psychophysiology of Emotion (SHAPE) project](https://lab-can.com/shape/) EEG dataset.

## Verification Architecture

### Test Levels

Each verification script operates at multiple levels:

| Level | What It Tests | Why It Matters |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Syntax** | Every `.py` file compiles without errors | Catches import failures, API changes (e.g., `np.trapz` → `np.trapezoid`), and typos |
| **Component** | Individual functions produce correct outputs on synthetic data | Validates that the LIF reservoir, BSC6 encoder, GNN layers, statistical tests, etc. are implemented correctly |
| **Integration** | End-to-end mini-pipelines run on small synthetic data | Validates that components work together (reservoir → encoding → PCA → classification) |
| **Consistency** | Cross-script parameter agreement | Ensures all scripts use the same reservoir parameters (N=256, beta=0.05, theta=0.5) |
| **Determinism** | Same inputs produce same outputs | Validates reproducibility via fixed random seeds |

### What Tests Cannot Cover

The verification scripts do **not** test:
- Classification accuracy on real SHAPE EEG data (requires dataset access)
- Statistical significance of clinical findings (requires full sample)
- Figure aesthetics or formatting

These limitations are by design. The tests validate that the *machinery* is correct; the *findings* depend on the data, which is separately validated by the `validation/` scripts.

## Key Algorithmic Validations

The tests go beyond simple "does it run" checks. Here are the critical algorithmic validations that establish correctness:

### 1. LIF Reservoir Correctness (tested in 7 scripts)

- **Weight shapes:** W_in is (N_res, 1), W_rec is (N_res, N_res) — verified in every script
- **Spectral radius:** Eigenvalue scaling produces exactly 0.9 (tolerance < 0.05)
- **Binary spikes:** Output values are exactly 0.0 or 1.0 — no floating-point artifacts
- **Non-negative membrane:** Membrane potential never goes below zero (floor constraint verified)
- **Determinism:** Same seed produces identical spike trains across runs
- **Channel independence:** Different seeds (seed + ch * 17) produce different reservoir dynamics

**Why this matters:** If the reservoir produced non-binary spikes, negative membrane potentials, or non-deterministic outputs, every downstream analysis would be invalid.

### 2. BSC6 Temporal Encoding (tested in 4 scripts)

- **Dimensionality:** 6 bins x N_res neurons = correct feature vector length
- **Non-negativity:** Spike counts cannot be negative
- **Conservation:** Sum of binned counts matches total spike count (minus remainder from integer division)

**Why this matters:** BSC6 is the core temporal coding scheme. If it produced wrong-dimensional vectors or negative counts, classification results would be meaningless.

### 3. Subject Centering (tested in verify_experiment_zero.py)

- **Per-subject mean is exactly zero** after centering (verified to tolerance 1e-10)
- **Does not modify the input array** (copy semantics verified)
- **Changes feature values** (centering has measurable effect)

**Why this matters:** Subject centering is critical for the Experiment Zero disambiguation. If centering didn't actually zero the per-subject mean, the "centered vs uncentered" comparison would be invalid.

### 4. Driven Lyapunov Exponent (tested in verify_reproduce_chapter6.py)

- **Benettin algorithm runs** on the LIFReservoirFull class
- **lambda_1 < 0** on synthetic data (Echo State Property verified)
- **Finite value** (no divergence or NaN)
- **Convergence trace returned** (algorithm produces interpretable output)

**Why this matters:** The entire Chapter 6 experimental program depends on the reservoir operating in the echo state regime (lambda_1 < 0). This test validates the Benettin algorithm implementation on the actual reservoir class used in the experiments.

### 5. Permutation Entropy Validation (tested in verify_reproduce_chapter6.py)

- **Random signal → PE ~ 1.0** (actual: 0.997). A random signal has maximum disorder, so PE should be near 1.0
- **Monotonic signal → PE ~ 0.0** (actual: 0.000). A monotonic signal has a single permutation pattern, so PE should be near 0.0

**Why this matters:** PE is one of the two temporal-structure metrics (alongside tau_AC) that carry the strongest condition effects in Chapter 6. These ground-truth tests verify the PE computation against known theoretical values.

### 6. Surrogate Generation (tested in 2 scripts)

- **Phase-randomized surrogates preserve the power spectrum exactly** (verified to rtol=1e-10)
- **Phase-randomized surrogates change the temporal signal** (not identical to original)
- **Time-shuffled surrogates preserve the amplitude distribution** (sorted values match)
- **Time-shuffled surrogates change temporal order** (not identical to original)

**Why this matters:** Surrogate testing (Experiment 6.3) is the validity gate for all dynamical metrics. If surrogates didn't properly preserve/destroy the intended signal properties, the surrogate sensitivity results would be meaningless.

### 7. GNN Layer Correctness (tested in verify_reproduce_chapter5.py)

- **GCN:** Symmetric normalized message passing (D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2} H W) produces finite, correct-shape outputs
- **GraphSAGE:** Self-features concatenated with mean-aggregated neighbor features doubles the feature dimension
- **GAT:** Softmax attention weights sum to exactly 1.0 (tolerance 1e-6) per node

**Why this matters:** All three GNN architectures are implemented from scratch in NumPy (no PyTorch/DGL). These tests validate that the manual implementations match the published algorithms.

### 8. Coupling Matrix Extraction (tested in verify_extract_utilities.py)

- **Mock pickle data** mimics the exact structure of ch7_full_results.pkl
- **Kappa values in [0, 1]** — coupling strength is a normalized Frobenius norm
- **Correlation values in [-1, 1]** — Spearman correlations are bounded
- **C matrices have shape (7, 2)** — 7 dynamical metrics x 2 topological metrics
- **CSV output has correct column count** (5 for kappa, 16 for C matrices)
- **Cross-utility consistency** — same (subject, category) pairs in both extractions

**Why this matters:** The extraction utilities convert pickle results to CSV for transparency. If the CSV format were wrong (wrong columns, out-of-range values, missing rows), any downstream analysis of the exported data would be incorrect.

### 9. Cross-Validation Pipeline (tested in 4 scripts)

- **StratifiedGroupKFold** used everywhere (prevents subject leakage)
- **PCA fitted per fold** on training data only (no data leakage)
- **Fold accuracies in [0, 1]** and finite
- **Correct number of folds** returned

**Why this matters:** Subject leakage (training on data from a subject who appears in the test set) would inflate accuracy. The tests verify that the CV splitting and PCA fitting follow the correct protocol.

## Limitations and Honest Assessment

### What the tests prove

- Every script in the repository parses and imports without errors
- Core algorithms (LIF reservoir, BSC6, PE, Lyapunov, GNN, surrogates) produce mathematically correct outputs on synthetic data with known ground truth
- The end-to-end pipeline (data → reservoir → features → classification) runs without errors
- Parameters are consistent across all scripts (N=256, beta=0.05, threshold=0.5, seed=42)
- Output formats (pickle, CSV, PDF) are produced correctly

### What the tests do not prove

- That classification accuracy on real SHAPE EEG data matches the reported values (requires dataset access)
- That statistical significance of clinical findings is reproducible (requires full 211-subject sample)
- That the experimental design is optimal (a methodological question, not a code correctness question)
- That the results generalize to other EEG datasets (an external validity question)

### Why this level of verification is sufficient

The verification strategy follows the principle of **compositional correctness**: if every component is individually correct, and the integration between components is verified, then the full pipeline is correct. The remaining uncertainty is in the *data*, not the *code*. The data itself is validated by the `validation/` scripts (10 + 12 automated checks on file format, dimensions, amplitude ranges, and cross-referencing).

## Independent Review

Chapter 6 has an additional layer of verification: `CHAPTER6_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` (746 lines), an independent code review that provides 27 additional synthetic unit tests and identifies 4 methodological issues (1 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 1 LOW). This external review validates not just code correctness but scientific methodology.
